# arduino-bldc
Brushless motor has many advantages, the development of a brushless motor controller requires a lot of knowledge and experience
the project uses Arduino UNO( atmega328) as the basis for development, the controller is characterized by:

1, support for a sensored or sensorless bldc motor

2, support for open loop and closed loop

3, software and hardware current protection

4, serial communication
